# My_First_Game
This is going to be the first game I ever made using HTML, CSS, and Javascript......Hopefully.

The current direction of the game is to make a zeldaish style game where the point og winning the game is to defeat all fightable charcter in the. 7 enemies is the plan. the battles are to going to be in the same style as pokemon or Final Fantasy with players able to choose a move on and to use the move on the next turn. you will be able to move the character with either the arrow keys or with 'wasd' depending on hand dominance. players will be given an intial weapon set and then afterwards will gain the weapon set of the enemy that was defeated just defeated, making the player more stronger for the next opponent.

More will be added depending on timeline 

Objectives:
1. Find Sprites for the game - completedish
2. Shape the First functions for different actions that are anticipated to be in tha game - In prgress.
3. Find Background theme and color style - Completed 

New Objectives:
1. Correct Move.js so that it works for this project
2. Design the first background scene with sprites to test interactivity
3. Possibly work on smalll script for talking interactions

Update. Trying to add different mapp that fit what im trying to accomplish with my classes. The background is the only thing keeping me from working on movement abilities. hope to be further along soon.
